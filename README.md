This Bash script generates a system status report, displaying information about the system, CPU and memory usage, disk space, processes, network connections, logs, and services. It utilizes a colorful progress bar and indicators for successful or failed command execution. The script produces both a detailed report in a specified file and a concise summary with colored status messages on the terminal. Users can easily assess the health of their Linux system by checking the summary, and the detailed report is saved for further analysis.
